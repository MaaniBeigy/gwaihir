ðŸ¦… Essential Statistical Functions for Rust

The authors' intention is to create a toolbox to facilitate the use of various *descriptive* statistical functions and resources in favor of an easier, scientifically recognized standard for implementing **Rust** statistical applications.

# Getting started

If you are using Linux or macOS, you need to install **Rust** using [rustup](<https://rustup.rs/>):

```shell
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

For installation on Windows, read the instruction in [rust-lang book](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installing-rustup-on-windows>).
